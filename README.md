This repository contains the code for the exercises and final project of the course 'The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022' by Colt Steele, which covers a comprehensive journey from HTML, CSS, JS to deployment, including backend and database. The YelpCamp folder constains the final project of the course, while fulbitoYelp contains a personal version of that final work.
